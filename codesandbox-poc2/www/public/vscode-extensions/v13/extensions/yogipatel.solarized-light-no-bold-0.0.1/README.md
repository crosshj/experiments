# README

I really like the version of Solarized Light shipped with VSCode but I don't like that it bolds all storage tokens (types and modifiers). This version of the theme removes that styling.

**Note**: there is an [outstanding bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29421) where a change in a theme's font style isn't immediately reflected in the UI. The workaround for this is to reload VSCode's window (_Reload Window_ in the _Command Palette_).
