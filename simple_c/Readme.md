## C and Javascript

this experiment began as a place to keep notes about writing a simple c program

later, as I was helping with some homework, I got the idea to write c code in a way that I was accustomed to writing code in the javascript ecosystem.  See [homeworkJs](./homeworkJS) where I implement a small portion of javascript goodness, `console.log`, in c

still later, I became curious about how to write javascript but output c or c++ code. See "for future reference" section


## for future reference

compile javascript to c - https://github.com/andrei-markeev/ts2c

## an example

try:
```
make run
```

outputs something like:
```
This is C Programming in Ubuntu
