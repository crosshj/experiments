### push it - 2021-01-15

piss on it and push it, you just can't take it
dish out the tumors, but your salty, simple, opposite sacred
notated the topics of theorisms ,widgets heuristics ancient
the mold grows quickly where you make the bathing

now everything's aching and you feeling dated
like where is the point and why can't you make it
the story wishy washy and you can no longer fake it
pushed to the point where you simply just hate it
