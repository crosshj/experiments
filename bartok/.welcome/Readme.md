# welcome!
This is Bartok, a system that is being created to help you create and manage your code!

Currently, this is a work in progress, but you can play around!

If you want an idea of what bartok can do, check out:

  - `terminal` pane, the right part of the screen.
  Try entering `help` then press `Enter` - not everything works, but some things do!!
  - `preview` mode can be chosen in the menu atop the terminal pane.
  Use it when you browse file examples.

  - `file-examples` folder, to the left in explorer tree.
  Try clicking one of these files and watching `preview` pane.

  - `.templates` folder.
  Exploring this will give you an idea of how `preview` works

Feel free to edit anything!  In Bartok's current state, you won't hurt anything!
