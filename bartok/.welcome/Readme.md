# welcome!
This is Bartok, a system that is designed to help you create and manage your code!

If you want an idea of what bartok can do, check out:

  - `terminal` pane, to the right.  Try entering `help` then press `Enter`
  - `preview` mode can be chosen in the menu atop the terminal pane
  - `file-examples` folder, to the left in explorer tree.  Try clicking one of these files and watching `preview` pane.
  - `.templates` will give you an idea of how `preview` works

Feel free to edit anything!  In Bartok's current state, you won't hurt anything!
