# 2020-10-23 - things I have known myself to be sick of

- hearing people gripe or argue about the behavior of huge corporations instead of spending resources on smaller projects/vendors/companies who are better positioned to behave properly
  ( it's much more fun to think we have a say in big brother's doings versus support little brother's half-baked WIP )

- the behavior of big corporations / prganizations
  - omg my Nexus 6P has been a nightmare and it seems I haven't had a reliable phone in a while if not ever
  - the Pixel 4 XL update to Android 11 causes multiple apps to crash and it seems the maker of the phone doesn't really care
  - immigration process and all it's paperwork suck
  - any time I intend to do something significant in my life, there is always some todo list of drudgery associated; I struggle to see how it benfits anyone
    - enroll kids in school
    - make a visit to the doctor or dentist
    - file taxes
