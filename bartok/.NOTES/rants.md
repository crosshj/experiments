# 2020-10-23 - things I have known myself to be sick of

- hearing people gripe or argue about the behavior of huge corporations instead of spending resources on smaller projects/vendors/companies who are better positioned to behave properly
  ( it's much more fun to think we have a say in big brother's doings versus support little brother's half-baked WIP )

- the behavior of big corporations / organizations / systems
  - omg my Nexus 6P has been a nightmare and it seems I haven't had a reliable phone in a while if not ever
  - the Pixel 4 XL update to Android 11 causes multiple apps to crash and it seems the maker of the phone doesn't really care
  - immigration process and all it's paperwork suck
  - any time I intend to do something significant in my life, there is always some todo list of drudgery associated; I struggle to see how it benfits anyone
    - enroll kids in school
    - make a visit to the doctor or dentist
    - file taxes
  - operating systems suck
  - enterprise code sucks
  - cars suck
  - computers suck
  - government sucks

- weekends being so short sucks

- Monday's suck

- working for "the man" sucks

- people suck

- speaking/writing sucks

- listening sucks


- discussions about all of these suck after about 1-2 hours of debating them
  - religion
  - philosophy
  - government
  - theoretical physics
  - gender issues
