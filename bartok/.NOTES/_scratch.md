<!-- no-select -->

why I keep vscode open
----------------------

- [ ] service worker flow is not merged to main flow
- [X] no search in project / folder

- [ ] awkward integration with file system
- [ ] buggy file management


- [X] doesn't recall scroll position
- [X] doesn't recall code collapse

- [X] can't dev/edit bartok in bartok
- [X] cant CRUD/save a file with service worker
- [X] highlight is weird (themeing and color issues)
- [X] no search in file

2020-10-11 todo
---------------
- [ ] minimap
- [ ] split editor (mutliple editor panes)
- [ ] preview performance issues
- [ ] javascript/modular templates (vs html-only)
- [ ] terminal watch file
- [ ] preview hot reloading
- [ ] dynamic/virtual files (to feed into preview)
- [ ] settings integration with service worker
- [ ] delay loading all services
- [ ] delay loading service on initial load (loading all code-BAD)
- [ ] diff view
- [ ] improved/cleaner service map
- [ ] system services connected to each other
- [ ] service details in service map
- [ ] command palette commands
- [ ] go to line number
- [ ] working directory in terminal prompt
- [ ] connect context menu commands
- [ ] arrange images on single image (use spritemap techniques/code)
- [ ] clean up and connect listeners/triggers
- [ ] hover highlighting expand/collapse indicators
- [ ] themes: font/colors
- [ ] automatic add vendor deps to service manifest (cached offline)
- [ ] package storage (like package.json/node_modules)
- [ ] all terminal commands working well (like unix)
- [ ] git support integrated
- [ ] share project (zip/torrent
- [ ] one template/multiple file extensions supported

image processing
----------------
- image clustering
	- keep a bunch of pictures as one file
	- disassembling: superpixels in javascript - https://github.com/kyamagu/js-segment-annotator/blob/master/js/image/segmentation/slico.js
	- assembling/packing: https://github.com/mapbox/potpack
	- image segmentation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF-3aORwEc0

- images with extra data
	- extra: 3d data, notes, etc
	- https://medium.com/better-programming/hide-data-within-an-image-507f571aab89
	- https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js
	- probably should wait until hex viewer is in place before going really far with this


2020-09-30 shaders webgl
------------------------
- http://webglplayground.net/ - I like the way source is handled here; divided into meaningful sections
- shadertoy
- fragment and vertex shaders - would like to support previews of these

2020-09-19 settings
-------------------
- settings view could be the first example of preview iframe that interacts with rest of the app
- settings should be a json file with .settings extension
- this should not be hidden at first, but may be later
- preview should be html that is loaded in iframe
- iframe should message the external app
- message should be heard by service worker handler and affect app settings
- these settings are used to update settings file (and consequentially, the html file)


2020-09-17 HUGE
---------------
- less tabs, close all tabs
- create/delete file/folder works with provider
- [x] issue with preview, binary file shows in preview instead
- settings tab issue on refresh
- CRUD, connecting service nodes working in service map (decide what it means to connect from code POV)
- [x] switch between tabs and spaces

2020-09-17 LOOSE
----------------
- demo driven development, versus ticket or changelog driven
- delivery versus debt (false dichotomy?)
- *.todo, *.slides, *.graph - all services should come with "native" support for these
	- graphs - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Infographics
- *.settings - treat settings as templated files with a common UI?
- connect git
	- https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git
	- real/beefy FS abstraction layer


2020-08-22 TODO
---------------

- [X] save a file with Bartok Basic Server provider

- [x] project switch

- list of curent providers in settings

- tons of issues
	- [X] tab closing closes tabs that shouldn't close
	- [X] preview doesn't show if project doesn't have templates (global templates)
	- [ ] project loads index.js even if it doesn't exist
	- [X] tabs are not recalled for projects other than welcome project
	- [X] switching between preview and terminal is broken in some cases
	- [X] settings view has tab switching problems
	- [X] preview fails after fresh boot

- preview full screen
	- should hide most UI elements; only show fullscreen controls
	- fullscreen state is wonky

2020-08-16 Note and Musing
==========================
- THIS SUCKS:  I am manually updating files and refreshing all the time

#### distractions | focus | procrastination
- lot's of things suck and need improved
- many things are cool and not big impact but fun to work on
- anxiety about first item and pain relieving effect of second item

DEPLOY | VERSION CONTROL
========================

	- [X] editor (load last loaded file)
	- [X] preview (load last loaded preview)
	- [X] panes (window width same as previous, recall positions)

connect all context menu items
	- huge list...

create|update|delete for service API in serviceHandler
	- need this before service worker fork can be merged

reset page for ui
	- [X] kill tree cache (sessionStorage)
	- [X] kill all the recalled things (above)
	- [ ] kill service worker cache (or maybe don't use this)
	- [X] kill service worker (which will be reloaded with boot())
	- [X] kill moduleCache (localStorage) (maybe should be sessionStorage)
	- [X] reloadServices true versus false
	- [ ] kill/reload serviceHandler

BUG: loading page shows loading bar multiple times

TIME AS MONEY
=============

- rephrase all tasks in terms of money and/or time
	- started work on Bartok on March 15, 2020
	- hourly pay rate ~=
	- average amount of time per day on bartok ~=

---------------
I want to be able to do little experiments
 - and easily share them
 - and not have to deal with build system
 - and not spin up a server
 - and later grow them

---------------
Examples of little experiments:
	- [ ] broken clock right twice a day
	- [ ] simluate a collection of people as faulty mirrors
	- [ ] architect stage of some project
	- [ ] emulate kubernetes, explore kubernetes pattern
	- [ ] services with central config service pattern

	- [ ] write a bunch of little modules then visually group and connect them
	- [ ] collect a ton of stuff and have something make me come back to them or recall them
	- [ ] search for unicode icons without leaving text editor
	- [ ] view fonts in editor
	- [ ] view/change/convert colors and color palettes in editor
	- [ ] write web code the way I want to, use files the way I want to

AN ATTEMPT AT FOCUS
===================

What is an MVP for Bartok?
	- CRUD services: editor, preview, templates?
	- visualize services & connections: service map
	- monitor services: service map
	- deploy services: ???
	- manage services: scale, scale policy, etc: ???

What are the nice-to-have sink holes?
- complete parity with items shown in MARKETING.md
- going too far with any given item listed in MVP statement
- open-endedness of the platform
- cool things to make release videos look nicer (preview)?

Potential Sinkhole Hard Examples:
- meta
	- how do UI services work? how much of Bartok UI is built with them?
	- can I build bartok with bartok editor?
- editor
	- could spend too much time (too much?) building an editor and putting all the cool things in it
	- perhaps editor should have it's own MVP/sink-hole evaluation
	- parity: does it do all the beloved editor things?
	- completeness: does it do everything right?
	- innovation: does it do cool things that other editors do not do?
- visuals
	- less concern about time waste here because visuals have appeal
	- would like to fully grasp how far is too far
	- there needs to be a basic set of items in service map
	- how they look is not as much important as how they connect
- monitor
	- similar case as with visuals
	- this depends on visuals being in place
	- need to be able to read logs
	- need to be able to view resource usage
- deploy
	- similar case as with visuals
	- is this a distinct item from manage (below)?
	- need to figure out how to do this
	- this depends on screens that have not been built
- manage
	- what does it mean to manage?
		- scale
		- scale policy
	- similar case as with visuals
	- need to figure out how to do this
	- this depends on screens that have not been built

What are currently the biggest "   "win"   " items?
	- [X] service map showing real services
	- [X] file templates (UI services)
	- [X] file preview (htm, svg, react)

	- files need id's for uniqueness <<< HUGE!!!
	- service save in chunks (because some files are huge)

	- [ ] service templates
	- [ ] logs streaming from server
	- [ ] metrics streaming from server
	- [ ] service map showing real stats
	- [X] direct file system based service (to enable next two wins)

	- [ ] UI ran from within bartok ecosystem (soft exploration into first-class services)
	- [ ] server ran from within bartok ecosystem (more serious foray into first-class services)



SORTED
======

FILE CHANGES
------------
 - [X] only keep changed tabs open, reuse previous/unchanged tabs
 - [X] tabs stay open across reload
 - [X] scroll/cursor position remembered
 - [X] allow closing last tab

PACKAGE.JSON / CONFIG
---------------------
 - [X] service should get its name from package.json
 - [ ] package.json should be ideal and not strict?
	 - (comments, unquoted, single quotes, trailing commas, etc)
 - [ ] package.json should be service.json? .bartok.yml ?

TEMPLATES
---------
 - [ ] templates for services? routeHandler, uiTemplate, plainNode, etc
 - [ ] eject templated app? (export)

PREVIEW
-------
 - [X] better release notes recording videos - page of code SUCKS!
 - [X] sidepane shows preview for React Component, HTML, markdown, etc
 - [X] use iframe: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5050380/set-innerhtml-of-an-iframe
 - [X] links are clickable in editor (NOPE - in preview instead)
 - document renders/previews differently for certain doc types
	 - [X] [.md] - show rendered html and allow to switch
	 - [X] [.svg]
	 - [X] [.jsx] - do react!
	 - [X] [.ipynb] - jupyter notebook
		 - https://github.com/jsvine/notebookjs
		 - https://github.com/finnp/ipynb
	 - [.tp.json] (made up) - sprite editor and mapped preview (texture packer)
